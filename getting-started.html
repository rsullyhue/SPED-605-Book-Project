            <h2>The AAC Journey: Where to Begin</h2>
            <p>Starting with AAC can feel overwhelming, but you don't have to figure everything out at once. This page will walk you through the typical process and help you understand what to expect.</p>
            
            <h2>Step-by-Step Process</h2>
            
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>
                    <h3>Recognize the Need</h3>
                    <p>You may have noticed your child struggles to communicate their needs, wants, or thoughts. This might show up as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Frustration or tantrums when they can't be understood</li>
                        <li>Limited or no spoken words</li>
                        <li>Speech that is difficult for others to understand</li>
                        <li>Difficulty participating in conversations</li>
                        <li>Reliance on pointing, pulling, or leading you to things</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you're seeing these signs, it may be time to explore AAC.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>Talk to Professionals</h3>
                    <p>Start by discussing AAC with professionals who know your child:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP):</strong> They specialize in communication and can assess your child's needs</li>
                        <li><strong>Special Education Teacher:</strong> They see how your child communicates at school</li>
                        <li><strong>Pediatrician or Developmental Pediatrician:</strong> They can provide referrals and medical documentation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="tip-box">
                        <h3>Tip: Don't wait for permission</h3>
                        <p>You don't need anyone's permission to start using low-tech AAC at home. Picture boards, communication books, and gestures can all be used right away while you work through the formal assessment process.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>Get an AAC Assessment</h3>
                    <p>An AAC assessment evaluates:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your child's current communication abilities</li>
                        <li>Their motor skills (how they access devices)</li>
                        <li>Their vision and hearing</li>
                        <li>Their cognitive and language skills</li>
                        <li>What environments they communicate in</li>
                        <li>What they want and need to communicate about</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The assessment may be done by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An SLP with AAC expertise</li>
                        <li>An AAC evaluation team (SLP, OT, special education teacher)</li>
                        <li>An AAC center or clinic</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="warning-box">
                        <h3>Red Flag: "Wait and See"</h3>
                        <p>If a professional tells you to "wait and see" before introducing AAC, get a second opinion. There are no prerequisites for AAC. Waiting denies your child communication.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>Try Different Options</h3>
                    <p>The assessment process usually includes trial periods with different AAC systems. Your child might try:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Low-tech options (picture boards, communication books)</li>
                        <li>Different AAC apps on a tablet</li>
                        <li>Dedicated speech-generating devices</li>
                        <li>Different access methods (touch, switch, eye gaze)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This trial period helps the team see what works best for your child.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>Include AAC in the IEP</h3>
                    <p>If your child has an IEP, AAC should be addressed in it. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Communication goals:</strong> What will your child learn to do with AAC?</li>
                        <li><strong>AAC as an accommodation:</strong> Your child needs access to their device all day</li>
                        <li><strong>Services:</strong> Who will support AAC implementation? (SLP, special ed teacher, paraeducator)</li>
                        <li><strong>Training:</strong> Who needs training on the device and how to support your child?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="tip-box">
                        <h3>Important: AAC is an Accommodation</h3>
                        <p>AAC is how your child accesses their education. It should be listed as an accommodation in the IEP, ensuring your child has it available at all times, not just during speech therapy.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>Secure Funding</h3>
                    <p>Once a device is recommended, work on getting it funded:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Insurance (private or Medicaid)</li>
                        <li>School district</li>
                        <li>Grants or nonprofit organizations</li>
                        <li>Purchase out-of-pocket (for apps or low-cost options)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>See the <a href="funding.html">Funding & Insurance</a> page for detailed information.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>Get Training</h3>
                    <p>Once your child has a device, everyone needs training:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Parents and family members</li>
                        <li>Teachers and school staff</li>
                        <li>Therapists</li>
                        <li>Your child (though they may learn faster than everyone else!)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Training typically covers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How to operate the device</li>
                        <li>Where vocabulary is located</li>
                        <li>How to model language using the device</li>
                        <li>How to customize and program vocabulary</li>
                        <li>Troubleshooting common problems</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>Start Using It!</h3>
                    <p>Implementation is where the real work begins. Your child needs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Access to their device all day, every day</li>
                        <li>Communication partners who model using the device</li>
                        <li>Opportunities to use AAC for real purposes</li>
                        <li>Time and patience to learn</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>See the <a href="implementation.html">Implementation</a> page for strategies.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Working with Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs)</h2>
            
            <h3>What to Look For in an SLP</h3>
            <p>Not all SLPs have extensive AAC training. Look for an SLP who:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Has experience with AAC (ask about their training and caseload)</li>
                <li>Uses AAC themselves when working with your child (modeling)</li>
                <li>Believes in presuming competence</li>
                <li>Supports AAC from the beginning, not as a last resort</li>
                <li>Works collaboratively with families and teachers</li>
                <li>Focuses on functional communication, not just device operation</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Questions to Ask Your SLP</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What AAC training have you completed?</li>
                <li>How many students on your caseload use AAC?</li>
                <li>Will you model using the device with my child?</li>
                <li>How will you ensure the device is available all day, not just during therapy?</li>
                <li>How will you train school staff and family members?</li>
                <li>What AAC goals are appropriate for my child right now?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h3>If Your SLP is Resistant to AAC</h3>
                <p>If an SLP tells you your child "isn't ready" for AAC, needs to master certain skills first, or that AAC will prevent speech, advocate for a second opinion. These are outdated beliefs not supported by research.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Timeline Expectations</h2>
            <p>Every child's AAC journey is different, but here's a general timeline:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial consultation:</strong> 1-2 weeks to schedule</li>
                <li><strong>AAC assessment:</strong> 1-3 sessions over 2-4 weeks</li>
                <li><strong>Trial period:</strong> 4-12 weeks</li>
                <li><strong>Funding approval:</strong> 2-6 months (varies widely)</li>
                <li><strong>Device arrival:</strong> 2-8 weeks after approval</li>
                <li><strong>Initial training:</strong> 1-4 sessions</li>
                <li><strong>Learning to use AAC:</strong> Ongoing, often takes 6-12 months to see consistent use</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Don't Wait for the "Perfect" Device</h3>
                <p>While you're going through the assessment and funding process, start using simple AAC right away. Picture boards, communication books, and free AAC apps give your child a way to communicate now, and the skills they learn transfer to more robust systems later.</p>

            <h2>You're Not Alone</h2>
            <p>The AAC journey can feel long and frustrating, especially when navigating assessments, funding, and training. Remember:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Many families have walked this path before you</li>
                <li>There are parent support groups (online and in-person) where you can ask questions and share experiences</li>
                <li>Your advocacy matters - push for what your child needs</li>
                <li>Progress may be slow at first, but it's worth it</li>
            </ul>
